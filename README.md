## Experience

#### Redesign the expereience of kpop fangirling/fanboying

**Target Users:** K-pop fans who have motivations to support or consume materials/media related to their kpop stars.

**Interviewed 10 Users**  
We attempted to look for user diversity/stratification within our user scope, using 3 axis:  

* Internationals / Koreans  
* Male / Female  
* Extremes / Moderate people  

We defined extremes as “constantly, actively supporting their stars”, whereas moderate users tend to merely consume their stars’ content.

7 Female, 	3 Male  
8 Korean, 	2 International  
6 Moderate, 	4 Extreme  

## Observations & Interviews
1. User 1: Korean, Female, Moderate, 23 year old -- Jiyoun

	* Fan of EXO, Youngmin Lim (Produce 101 / Brand New Music); since 2014
	* Started fangirling when she was a freshman at KAIST, going through a major phase of academic difficulties. 
	* Cheered up by watching how hard her idols work, in line with her own feelings/endeavour. When her idol seemed to slack/show off, she stopped fangirling.
	* Designed her chair for a school project after her favorite idol’s logo; to her, it didn’t feel like work at all. 
	* Doesn’t want to know too much about the privacy of her idols -- her idol is an icon of her hope, and she doesn’t want to ruin it.
	* “The best part about fangirling is that you don’t expect anything -- you don’t expect anything. There’s nothing to be sad about. Fangirling helped me go through my depression.” 
	* Listens to idol’s while working, watch one video every once in a while to cheer up
	* Official site(fancafe) 5 times a day

2. User 2 : Korean, Female, Extreme, 23 years old -- Jiyoun

	* Fan of Seong Wu Ong (Wanna One); since 2017
Liked him because he was kind : how he treats others / fans / how he’s thankful. Felt responsible to help his debut
	* “Fangirling him is not just a typical fangirling, but an encouragement of life.”
	* Balancing between fangirling v. life was difficult; not long since she balanced it out. (She used to miss classes, just watching him 24/7)
	* Watches v live / M net star live, partakes in official fan cafe, DC Inside
	* Has more than 30000 photos, so got icloud. Uses as database for writing posts.
	* Learned photoshop to make clips (takes 1+ hour per gif)  from videos while fangirling
	* Generates guidelines to help internationals comment/react/vote on her idol, as internationals have high accessibility bar
	* Streams overnight / on multiple screens to help increase idols’ rankings

	* Search Youtube with query “YYMMDD Groupname TVShowName”

4. User 4 : French, Female, Moderate, 21 years old -- Sindy
 
	* Fan of Pentagon for 4 years
	* When she’s lonely, watching music videos makes her feel better and laugh.
	* In France, there’s only one kpop store, which is in Paris, and the merchandise is expensive. For popular groups, they get sold out fast. Therefore, she pre-orders it, but it’s a risk because she doesn’t know if the album is good. However, the album still includes a poster.
	* In France, there are not a lot of kpop concerts, and it is hard getting tickets. In South Korea, she wants to bring her friends to the PC bang to help get tickets.
	* It was hard for her to get into the fan cafe because the instructions were all in Korean. It wasn't just the fan cafe as other notices and information were in Korean as well. She often spends much time Google translating.
	* She only checks up on content in Twitter, Facebook, and fan cafe after evaluating the notifications and alerts she gets.
	* She uses an SD card to store her photos. She organizes her photos by group and member. 
3000 photos BTS ; 2000 photos Pentagon
	* She said “she’s lazy and will just take what she is given”.

5. User 5 : Korean-Australian, Male, 21 years old -- Sindy
	* Fan of IU for 8 years
	* He goes to PC bang (with friends) to get tickets. 	* He knows the ticketing interface, so he practices clicking and typing his credit card number. 
	* He does not go out of his way to check up on content on Instagram and Facebook. He sees it when it pops up on his feed or his occasional check.
	* In Australia, he always buys the album on iTunes first and then later buys the physical album to support the artist but also for the poster.
	* He uses an SD card and cloud to store photos but “never goes back through them”.

## Needs

1. They need to maintain and categorize photos, and find appropriate photos at the right time.
2. They need to have certain versions of posters / goods, which sometimes requests trading with other people.
3. They want to watch their stars be in the same emotional state as them: when they’re lonely and struggling, they want to watch their idols also go make their way out through struggles than slack off.
4. Some (extreme) users want to watch the new content right away
5. They want to search for specific content/video/clips, but struggle as they do not know the right queries to search.
6. They need successful ticketing with less competition and effort. 
7. They want to meet the star in person, possibly in signing event / concert / bars / offline places.
8. They often need to skip through video parts for their favorite stars.
9. They (mostly extreme) need to help their stars reach higher rankings
10. Foreigner fans need translated contents with better accessibility in many domains (ex: fan cafes, various communities).
11. They need an easy understanding the norms/contents/responses from various online communities.
12. They want to feel a camaraderie by bonding to a fan club.



## Insights

1. It’s easy for fangirls/fanboys to get stigmatized due to cultural scorning; some of them are thus in denial.
2. They use multiple platforms(Youtube, Instagram, Naver/Daum Cafe, etc) of different personalities for different uses and norms.
3. They want media conveying a specific emotional state in line with their feelings. (ex : to commiserate with)
4. Foreigners feel they are left out, and feel that they deserve better accessibility to particular contents. (ex : accessibility to fan cafes and other new information)
5. Interface for fanclubs and communities are list-based, making it less optimal medium of information scent
6. Many of them use sd cards or clodus to save photos, as they possess too many photos. Photos are mostly categorized by dates/members.
7. Fans who have previous experience knows how to get ahead of the ticketing competition.
8. Doing an activity related to their favorite stars, even if it’s actual work, motivated them so much that they felt less tired.
9. To be a fan club staff, it takes a lot of money, effort, and proof of loyalty : some monetary donation (30k ~ 150k wons), some thousand streamings on videos/music streaming services, buying goods, participation in community, etc)
10. There is high accessibility barrier and vulgarity issues for novices, and learning of slangs, aliases may be difficult.
11. Most of fans don’t go above and beyond; they consume the media for their own good.  


## Studio Reflections


#### Feedback from the studio session includes:

 
**Students' comments**

* Liked well structured presentation
* Problems well found and good diversity of users
* Student suggested researching “고독한 kakotalk bang”, which is related to fangirling  
**(reflection) →** We will research it in our later DP’s.  
* Wished insights for platforms(for fan-girlying/fan-boying) are considered when designing the solution  
**(reflection) →** Different types of platforms are one of major culture/issue while fangirling/fanboying, as they need to use various platforms to aggregate necessary information. We have covered some distinct characteristics of various fangirling/fanboying platforms in our user interviews above, but will search more thoroughly in DP2 to confirm if it is a general issue across different fans



**TA’s comments**

* Seems to focus only on digital space  
**(reflection) →** Maintaining physical goods offline was mostly done by storing on desks, binders, cabinets, etc. We did address it in the presentation, but the users interviewed did not have striking problems or interesting insights in storing physical goods.
* Wish some needs on consuming/maintaining physical goods are considered  
**(reflection) →** We will investigate more issues with acquiring physical products with more user interviews.
