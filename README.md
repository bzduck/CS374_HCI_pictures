## POV
**User :** Korean kpop fangirls in high-school  
**User’s need :** need to see encouraging and empathizing contents of their stars easily  
**Surprising insight :** but stars’ contents of different personality are too scattered across and disorganized within platforms.

## Persona
![persona](https://cdn.rawgit.com/daram529/CS374_HCI_pictures/3306cd5f/DP2/persona.jpg)  
**Name :** Yuna Hwang  
**Age :** 19, Public high school  
**Race :** Korean  
**Gender :** Female  
**Fan for :** 1 year @ BTS  

**Preferences :**  

* Her bias : Jungkook  
* Instagram : short, funny clips / Twitter, Youtube vlog / Youtube : full video clips 

**Dislikes:**  

* doesn’t like show-off Kpop stars just showing off their money and fame

**Goals :**  

* “I will go to SKY!!!!! I WILL SUCCEED IN LIFE!”

**Hobbies :**  

* going to BTS concerts (1 time so far)
* Coin-karaoke and sings BTS songs

**Belief :**  

* “1 year = my life becomes different.”
* “Because I know they went through so many struggles and tried so hard to reach their dreams and I can feel that emotion when I listen to their songs, I don’t have the right to stop and I need to live up to them”  
“If you can’t fly, you should run,  
If you can’t run, you should walk,  
If you can’t walk, you should crawl”  
			- BTS “Not Today”

**Motivations :**  

* dance video clips where it shows BTS with “Blood, Sweat, Tears”
* sees them do interviews worldwide hosts (and compares them to their starting years)
* seeing her friends who got into science high schools

**Her start :**   
	When she has her free time at her night, trying to relieve some stress by browsing online freely. In katalk newsfeed, there is an aggregate of light gossip news / celebrity news, etc. As she constantly saw these clips, she grew somewhat fond of them because they were hot / looked like a lot of fun. She became a fan this winter @ January 2018, because she was so stressed and lonely due to her upcoming senior year. As she was browsing a lot, she saw many clips of Jungkook and thought he was cute / hot. 

**Daily Life :**  
	“When I do math, I like to listen to music.”
When she wakes up, she first looks at the poster on her wall and smiles for a good start to the day. As she gets ready for school, dresses up and have breakfast she listens to BTS’s music. While at school at break time, she talks about BTS with friends and watches music video / Vapp together. After class, she normally goes to the library or stays in school to study. When working on math problems, she listens to their music to feel get some energy. Between changing subjects, she watches a short clip of them dancing as a refreshment. After a long day of studying, she goes back to her home, into her bed and visits all sorts of platforms (Twitter, Youtube, Instagram, Fan cafes, etc) to catch up with new contents.

* Wish there were some distance between target user (Korean Female Fangirl in College) and our group members
**(reflection) →** We changed our POV's user to Teenager and modified Persona and HMWs accordingly
